___
Renames files in directory in lowercase

<H1>Usage</H1>
___
The usage is quite simple:

All files in the target directory will be renamed with the same name, in lowercase.

- lowerdir [-v] [directory] : if `directory` is omitted, it is assumed that you want to rename the files in the current directory.<br>
The `-v` switch means that you want verbose output.

- lowerdir --version : shows the version of the tool

- lowedir -h : shows an abbreviated help file
